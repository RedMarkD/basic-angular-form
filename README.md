## The Mission
we have been part of becode for a bit and thus made a lot of friends in the process. We will make an Angular application on which my friends can fill in their data so we can have it in your node.js friendlist api.

# Basic Angular Form Challenge: BeCode

- Repository: `basic-angular-form`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Solo challenge

## Learning Objectives 
After this learning challenge, it's exepected to understand and have the ability to use the following. 
- Use the angular cli commands. -self-reminder: cli stands for command line interface-
- Have a basic understanding of typescript.  initial search provides following insight: Typescript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript. 
- Generate components and services in angular. I expect this to become apparent while doing the exercise. 
- Configure a provided node API. I expect this to become apparent while doing the exercise. 
- Make a basic angular form. this will be in a following step. 
- Send http requests from an angular app to a node server. this will be in a following step. 

### Strategy
After reading the learning objectives I'm going to start by reading up on the basic CLI & typescript/JS differences. 
The other four objectives feel more practical and I feel that looking at previous exercises we'll get to understand all the terminoligy while doing the exercise. 

### Features - checklist :heavy_check_mark:
-finished elements will be checked off-
>__Must have features__
>All the fields you need to put the data of your friends in your friendlist. These are:
>- First name
>- Last name
>- Email
>- Phone number
>- Favourite language (html, css, js, php, ...), this will be a select with options

>Error reporting, give some visual feedback to the user if they put something wrong in the inputs.

>Form validation

>A Friend list, do this by sending a GET request to your local node server.

>A POST request to add a friend to your friend list.


__Nice-to-have features__
>- Make sure the email and phone number are actually emails and phone numbers.
>- Make it as easy as possible for a user to add a phone number, following phone numbers could all be valid:
>    - +324888 88888
>    - 04 88 88 88 88
>    - 0      4 8     8 8888 88
>    - It's okay to only take Belgian phone numbers into account.
>- Make seperate pages for adding a friend and your friend list.
>- Make a "best friend" list by adding a favourite checkbox to the form
>    - You can also make a seperate page for your best friends
>    - You'll have to make a new app.GET function in your node server
>- Add extra fields, whatever you like. Examples:
>    - Profile picture
>    - Signature move
>    - Favourite meme
>    - ...
>- Think of your own new app.GET function, the possibilities are endless. Examples:
>    - A list of all the people that like php
>    - An amount of random friends from your list
>    - A list of all the people between the age of 30 and 40
>    - ...

What we might need to mention is that for this exercise as it's our first Angular app we're making that we received great documentation and a step-by step for the initial use of angular which you can review in the initial challenge repo [__here__](https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Lamarr-5.34/tree/fffc56a288a6d83f400d775589f910472fa12220/2.The-Hill/angular/intro)
